## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Internet connection for loading M3U playlists

### Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. **Option A: Run from local server (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx http-server -p 8000
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

3. **Option B: Open directly in browser**
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Note: Some playlists may not load due to CORS restrictions
   - The app will show sample channels for demonstration

4. The app will automatically load some default playlists

### Adding Custom Playlists

1. Click the "Add Playlist" button
2. Enter a valid M3U URL
3. Optionally provide a custom name for the playlist
4. Click "Load Playlist"

## Sample M3U URLs

The platform now uses the official [iptv-org/iptv](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv) repository as the primary source, which provides over 97k+ channels worldwide. Here are the main playlists:

### Official iptv-org Playlists (Recommended)
- **All Channels**: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/index.m3u` - Complete collection
- **USA Channels**: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/us.m3u`
- **UK Channels**: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/gb.m3u`
- **Canada Channels**: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/ca.m3u`

### Regional Collections
- **Germany**: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/de.m3u`
- **France**: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/fr.m3u`
- **Italy**: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/it.m3u`
- **Spain**: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/es.m3u`
- **Japan**: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/jp.m3u`
- **India**: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/countries/in.m3u`

### Category-Based Playlists
- **News Channels**: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/categories/news.m3u`
- **Sports Channels**: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/categories/sport.m3u`
- **Music Channels**: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/categories/music.m3u`

### Language-Based Playlists
- **English**: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/languages/eng.m3u`
- **Spanish**: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/languages/spa.m3u`
- **French**: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/languages/fra.m3u`
- **German**: `https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/languages/deu.m3u`

## How It Works

### M3U Parsing
The platform uses a custom M3U parser that:
- Extracts channel information from EXTINF lines
- Resolves relative URLs to absolute URLs
- Categorizes channels based on group titles
- Handles both M3U and M3U8 formats

### Video Streaming
- Uses HLS.js for HLS stream playback
- Falls back to native HLS support (Safari)
- Handles stream errors gracefully
- Supports fullscreen playback

### Data Storage
- Favorites are stored in browser localStorage
- No server required - runs entirely client-side
- All data stays on your device

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome 60+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 55+
- ‚úÖ Safari 11+
- ‚úÖ Edge 79+

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Channels showing as "Unknown Channel"?**
- This is likely due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions
- **Solution**: Run the app from a local server instead of opening the HTML file directly
- Use `python -m http.server 8000` or `npx http-server -p 8000`
- The app includes sample channels that will work regardless

**Channels not loading?**
- Check if the M3U URL is accessible
- Some playlists may be temporarily unavailable
- Try a different M3U URL
- Run from a local server to avoid CORS issues

**Video not playing?**
- Ensure your browser supports HLS
- Check your internet connection
- Some streams may be geo-restricted
- Try different channels as some streams may be offline

**Slow loading?**
- Large playlists may take time to load
- Check your internet speed
- Try refreshing the page
- The iptv-org main playlist contains 97k+ channels

### Error Messages

- **"Failed to load playlist"** - The M3U URL is not accessible
- **"HLS is not supported"** - Your browser doesn't support HLS streaming
- **"Network error"** - Connection issues or stream unavailable
